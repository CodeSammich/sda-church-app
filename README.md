## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- For iOS: Xcode (macOS only) targeting iPhone 16 on iOS 18.0 or higher
- For Android: Android Studio and Android SDK 35+

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Testing

### iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

This command:

- Builds the iOS app using Expo
- Requires a Mac with Xcode installed
- Launches the app on the iOS Simulator or a connected device
- Verify on iOS 18.0 or higher

### Android

```bash
npm run android
```

This command:

- Builds the Android app using Expo
- Requires Android Studio or Android SDK set up
- Launches the app on the Android Emulator or a connected device
- Verify on Android SDK 35 or higher

## Release & Versioning

This project uses **Semantic Versioning** with the following rules:

- **#patch** — Backward compatible bug fixes (e.g., `0.1.0` → `0.1.1`)
- **#minor** — Backward compatible new features (e.g., `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`)
- **#major** — Breaking changes (e.g., `0.1.0` → `1.0.0`)

### Release Process

1. **Create a Release Branch** from `main` if none are actively being worked on:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/0.2.0
   git push -u origin release/0.2.0
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** from `release/0.2.0` → `main`:
   - Add exactly one version tag in the PR description: `#patch`, `#minor`, or `#major`
   - Complete testing checklist
   - Wait for PR checks to pass

3. **Automated Tag Creation**:
   - The `Release Auto-Tag` workflow validates the PR body
   - On merge, it automatically creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
   - The version is bumped based on your chosen semantic version tag

4. **Merge to Main**:
   - Merge the PR to `main`
   - A release tag is automatically created on the merge commit
   - The tag follows the format: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`

## Branch Protection & Workflow

### Branch Hierarchy

```
main (stable)
  ↑
  └─ release/0.2.0 (release candidate)
       ↑
       └─ feature/awesome-feature (work in progress)
```

### Branch Rules

#### `main` Branch

- **Protected branch** — Cannot push directly
- **Requires PR** — All changes must come through a pull request
- **Requires PR reviews** — Pull requests must be approved before merge
- **Requires checks to pass** — CI/CD checks must pass
- **Source**: Only from `release/**` branches
- **Auto-tag on merge** — Automatically creates semantic version tags

#### `release/*` Branches

- **Source**: Created from `main` for each release
- **Naming convention**: `release/0.2.0` (matches semantic version)
- **Purpose**: Prepare the release and validate the version bump
- **PR validation**:
  - Enforces exactly one version tag (`#patch`, `#minor`, or `#major`)
  - Prevents PRs without a version tag
  - Prevents PRs with multiple version tags

#### Feature/Work Branches

- **Naming convention**: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, etc.
- **Source**: Branch from `release/*` or directly from `main`
- **PR**: Create PR to target release branch or main
- **Target**: Should merge back to the appropriate release branch

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `release/0.2.0` or `main`
2. **Make your changes** and commit with clear messages
3. **Push to origin** and create a PR
4. **Fill PR template**:
   - Select one version tag: `#patch`, `#minor`, or `#major`
   - Complete testing checklist
   - Add description of changes
5. **Await checks**:
   - Workflow validates version tag
   - Tests and linting run
   - Reviews are requested
6. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the PR
7. **If merging to main**: Automatic release tag is created

### Automated Checks

#### `Release Auto-Tag` Workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml`)

**Pre-merge check** (`enforce-tag` job):

- Runs on: PR open, edit, sync, new commits
- Validates: Exactly one semantic version tag in PR description
- Fails if: No tag or multiple tags found

**Release tagging** (`tag` job):

- Runs on: PR merge to `main` from `release/*` branch
- Creates: Semantic version tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- Bump type: Determined by `#major`, `#minor`, or `#patch` in PR body

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start from main
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. Create release branch
git checkout -b release/0.2.0
git push -u origin release/0.2.0

# 3. Create feature branch from release
git checkout -b feature/new-calendar-view
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: add calendar view for sermon schedule"
git push -u origin feature/new-calendar-view

# 4. Create PR: feature/new-calendar-view → release/0.2.0
# Add "#minor" to PR description (new feature)
# Get approval and merge

# 5. Create PR: release/0.2.0 → main
# Add "#minor" to PR description (matches version bump)
# Get approval and merge

# 6. Automated: Tag v0.2.0 is created on merge commit
# Done! Release is published.
```
